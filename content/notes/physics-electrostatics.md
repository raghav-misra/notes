## Charge.
- Some things have a **positive** charge and others have a **negative** charge.
    - Opposite charges attract each other.
    - Like charges repel away from each other.
    - Charged objects attract neutral (uncharged) objects
- Contact:
    - Movement/transfer of electrons between objects.
- **e** is the charge of a proton.
    - **-e** is the charge of an electrons.
- The **coulomb** *(C)* is a unit of charge.
    - *1C ~= (6.24)(10^18)(e)* is a coulomb in terms of *e*.
    - *e ~= (1.60)(10^(-19)) C* is *e* in terms of coulombs.
    - A coulomb is the amount of charge transferred by a *1A* current in *1s*.
        - *1A* refers to *1* ampere, a unit of current.

## Coulomb's Law.
- *F(e) =(k * |q(1) \* q(2)|) / r^2*
    - *F(e)* is electrostatic force. Units is *Nm^2 / C^2*
    - *q(1)* and *q(2)* are the magnitudes of the 2 charges.
        - If *q(1)* and *q(2)* has same signs, repelling force.
        - If they are different signs, attractive force.
    - *k ~= 9 \* 10^9*

## Ohm's Law.
- *V = IR*
    - **Voltage** *(V)*
        - electric potential
        - PE per unit charge
        - measured in Volts *(V)* which is *J/C*
    - **Current** *(I)*
        - change per unit time
        - measured in *C/s* aka amperes *(A)*
    - **Resistance** *(R)*
        - how much charge flow impeded
        - denoted by Î©

## Power.
- *P = VI*
- *P = RI^2*
