## Charge.

-   Some things have a **positive** charge and others have a **negative** charge.
    -   Opposite charges attract each other.
    -   Like charges repel away from each other.
    -   Charged objects attract neutral (uncharged) objects
-   Contact:
    -   Movement/transfer of electrons between objects.
-   **e** is the charge of a proton.
    -   **-e** is the charge of an electrons.
-   The **coulomb** _(C)_ is a unit of charge.
    -   _1C ~= (6.24)(10^18)(e)_ is a coulomb in terms of _e_.
    -   _e ~= (1.60)(10^(-19)) C_ is _e_ in terms of coulombs.
    -   A coulomb is the amount of charge transferred by a _1A_ current in _1s_.
        -   _1A_ refers to _1_ ampere, a unit of current.

## Coulomb's Law.

-   _F(e) =(k _ |q(1) \* q(2)|) / r^2\*
    -   _F(e)_ is electrostatic force. Units is _Nm^2 / C^2_
    -   _q(1)_ and _q(2)_ are the magnitudes of the 2 charges.
        -   If _q(1)_ and _q(2)_ has same signs, repelling force.
        -   If they are different signs, attractive force.
    -   _k ~= 9 \* 10^9_

## Ohm's Law.

-   _V = IR_
    -   **Voltage** _(V)_
        -   electric potential
        -   PE per unit charge
        -   measured in Volts _(V)_ which is _J/C_
    -   **Current** _(I)_
        -   change per unit time
        -   measured in _C/s_ aka amperes _(A)_
    -   **Resistance** _(R)_
        -   how much charge flow impeded
        -   denoted by Î©

## Power.

-   _P = VI_
-   _P = RI^2_
