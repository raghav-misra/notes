title: Work/Energy/Power

## Work.
- Amount of energy transferred by a force, measured in joules *(J)*.
- Work formula: *W = Fdcosθ*
    - *θ* is the direction of the acting force *F* relative to the displacement *d*
    - Horizontal work: *cosθ = 1*
    - Vertical work: *cosθ = 0*
        - No work is done as *Fdcosθ = 0*
- **Net work** is the work of all forces on an object added up.
- **Work-energy principle** says that the net work done on a object is equal to the change in KE of the object.
    - *W(net) = KE(f) - KE(i)*
    - If the object started at rest, the initial KE is zero.
    - This means that the net work done is equal to the the final KE.
- Things to remember: 
    - Forces acting perpendicular to displacement do zero work.
    - The sign of the work means something.
        - Positive work (+) means it receives energy from surroundings.
        - Negative work (-) means it gives energy to surroundings.
            - Negative work occurs when force is opposite the direction of displacement.

## Kinetic Energy.
- The energy an object has because of its motion.
    - *KE = (1/2)mv^2*
- Change in kinetic energy is the net work done on an object.
    - *KE(f) - KE(i) = W(net)*

## Springs.
- Given a spring that moves *d* meters when a net force *F* newtons is applied:
    - The spring constant is *k = F/d*
    - The restoring force is *F(r) = -kx*
        - The negative sign refers to the reversal of the spring.
    - This is **Hooke's Law**, which states the the restoring force of a spring is proportional to its displacement.
- Relating springs to work:
    - *W = (1/2)kx^2*
    - Once the spring is at rest, its **potential energy** is equal to the work done.
        - *PE = (1/2)kx^2*

## Gravitational potential energy.
- Energy due to position of an object in a gravitational field.
- Formula is *U = mgh*:
    - *U* is the gravitational potential energy.
    - *m* is the object's mass.
    - *g* is the gravitational acceleration.
    - *h* is the change in height.
- When finding *U*, the specific measures of height (aka where *h = 0*) is unnecessary as the gravitational potential energy only depends on change in height.
    - To find the change in height just do *h(f) - h(i)*

## Conservation of energy.
- Energy is neither created nor destroyed, but can only be transformed from one form to another or from one system to another.
    - *KE(i) + PE(i) = KE(f) + PE(f)*
        - Assuming no dissipative forces.

## Power.
- **Power** is the amount of work done over time.
    - *P = W/t*
    - Measured in *J/s*, called a **watt** *(W)*
- This is technically **average power**, as we measure the power over a time interval.
    - **Instantaneous power** would be power at a specific *instance* of time, rather than over an interval.
    - *P = Fvcosθ*, where *v* is the instantaneous velocity at the desired point in time.
