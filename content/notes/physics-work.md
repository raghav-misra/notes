## Work.

-   Amount of energy transferred by a force, measured in joules _(J)_.
-   Work formula: _W = Fdcosθ_
    -   _θ_ is the direction of the acting force _F_ relative to the displacement _d_
    -   Horizontal work: _cosθ = 1_
    -   Vertical work: _cosθ = 0_
        -   No work is done as _Fdcosθ = 0_
-   **Net work** is the work of all forces on an object added up.
-   **Work-energy principle** says that the net work done on a object is equal to the change in KE of the object.
    -   _W(net) = KE(f) - KE(i)_
    -   If the object started at rest, the initial KE is zero.
    -   This means that the net work done is equal to the the final KE.
-   Things to remember:
    -   Forces acting perpendicular to displacement do zero work.
    -   The sign of the work means something.
        -   Positive work (+) means it receives energy from surroundings.
        -   Negative work (-) means it gives energy to surroundings.
            -   Negative work occurs when force is opposite the direction of displacement.

## Kinetic Energy.

-   The energy an object has because of its motion.
    -   _KE = (1/2)mv^2_
-   Change in kinetic energy is the net work done on an object.
    -   _KE(f) - KE(i) = W(net)_

## Springs.

-   Given a spring that moves _d_ meters when a net force _F_ newtons is applied:
    -   The spring constant is _k = F/d_
    -   The restoring force is _F(r) = -kx_
        -   The negative sign refers to the reversal of the spring.
    -   This is **Hooke's Law**, which states the the restoring force of a spring is proportional to its displacement.
-   Relating springs to work:
    -   _W = (1/2)kx^2_
    -   Once the spring is at rest, its **potential energy** is equal to the work done.
        -   _PE = (1/2)kx^2_

## Gravitational potential energy.

-   Energy due to position of an object in a gravitational field.
-   Formula is _U = mgh_:
    -   _U_ is the gravitational potential energy.
    -   _m_ is the object's mass.
    -   _g_ is the gravitational acceleration.
    -   _h_ is the change in height.
-   When finding _U_, the specific measures of height (aka where _h = 0_) is unnecessary as the gravitational potential energy only depends on change in height.
    -   To find the change in height just do _h(f) - h(i)_

## Conservation of energy.

-   Energy is neither created nor destroyed, but can only be transformed from one form to another or from one system to another.
    -   _KE(i) + PE(i) = KE(f) + PE(f)_
        -   Assuming no dissipative forces.

## Power.

-   **Power** is the amount of work done over time.
    -   _P = W/t_
    -   Measured in _J/s_, called a **watt** _(W)_
-   This is technically **average power**, as we measure the power over a time interval.
    -   **Instantaneous power** would be power at a specific _instance_ of time, rather than over an interval.
    -   _P = Fvcosθ_, where _v_ is the instantaneous velocity at the desired point in time.
