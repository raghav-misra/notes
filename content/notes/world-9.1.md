## Communication.

-   By 1990s, phones allowed for easier communication and spread of information.
-   Social networking sites made media universally available.
-   Political impacts of this mobile revolution.
    -   Video recordings spread online of unethical police actions resulted to inquires of racial profiling and outrage resulted.
    -   **Arab Spring** was series of anti-gov't protests in the 2010s across Africa as people shared protest experiences on social media.

## Green Revolution (mid-1900s).

-   Possible long-term solution for hunger.
-   Scientists created new grains with higher yields and resistance to weather and pests.
-   These original process of creating new grains and plants was **cross-breeding**.
    -   Breeding 2 varieties of plants to form a hybrid.
-   Nowadays, **genetic engineering** is a way to create and modify plants.
    -   Manipulating cells or organisms to change basic properties.
-   Also used:
    -   Irrigation, fertilizers, and pesticides.
    -   Clearning forests to make room for agriculture.
-   Problems with Green Revolution solutions:
    -   Small farmers were often unsuccessful compared to larger landowners because they couldn't afford fertilizers and pesticides.
    -   Heavy chemical use damaged soil and environment.
    -   Increased mechanization drove many farm workers out of work.

## Energy Technologies.

-   In 1900, coal was over half the global energy usage.
-   As extraction/refinement improved and spread, crude oil (petroleum) and natural gas was more used to fuel industry.
-   Fossil fuels:
    -   Non-renewable resources meant once they were used up, they were unreplenishable.
    -   Contribute heavily to climate change and global warming.
-   Nuclear energy is a renewable, clean form of energy:
    -   However, it poses many dangers.
    -   Accidents while nuclear energty are fatal and direct contact is very dangerous.
-   Other renewable resources such as solar and wind power was danger-free.
    -   Are becoming more in use, only 5% global energy output.

## Medical Innovations.

-   **Antibiotics** were substances that killed bacteria.
    -   Made injuries and diseases once fatal easily curable.
    -   First antibiotic was penicillin.
        -   Saved many lives during WWII.
        -   Spread to civilians postwar and fought many illnesses.
-   **Birth control pill** was more reliable than prior methods.
    -   Transformed gender roles and soon enough >300M women used modern forms of contraception.
-   **Vaccines** were now developed and widely spread to fight many deadly diseases.
    -   Prevent as many as 3M deaths a year and better distribution would save even more.
