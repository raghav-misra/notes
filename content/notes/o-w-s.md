# Kinematic equations.
- Review of the four main kinematics equations.

# Momentum review.
- *p = mv*
    - Formula for an object’s momentum.
- *(m1)(v1i) + (m2)(v2i) = (m1)(v1f) + (m2)(v2f)*
    - Two objects collide and stick together.
- *(m1)(v1i) + (m2)(v2i) = vf(m1 + v1)*
    - Two objects collide and stick together.

# Wave characteristics.

- A **wave** is a disturbance propagating through space that usually transfers energy.
    - Acts in a ripple effect.
- Types of waves:
    - A **transverse wave** is a wave with oscillations perpendicular to the direction of propagation.
    - A **longitudinal wave** is a wave with oscillations parallel to the direction of propagation.
- A **periodic wave** follows the pattern of a sinusoidal function and moves with constant speed.
    - The wave’s **peak** is its highest point.
    - The wave’s **trough** is its lowest point.
    - A wave’s **amplitude** is the distance from its resting position to its peak. 
    - A wave’s **period (*T*)** is the time taken for each cycle.
    - A cycle is resetting to the same position & direction.
    - A wave’s **frequency (*f*)** is the number of cycles per second.
        - *f = 1/T*, the period and frequency are reciprocals of each other.
        - Measured in hertz **(*Hz*)**, aka. cycles/second.
    - A **wavelength (*λ*)** is how far the wave has traveled after 1 period.
    - A **cycle** can be measured from peak to peak, or trough to trough.
    - The wave’s **velocity** is *v = λ/T = λf*
        - Wavelength in the time of a period.

# Wave interference.

- To figure out what happens when two wave pulses collide, you can add the waves visually.
    - This applies for partial overlap as well.
    - The wave interference is only during the overlap, but after they pass through each other, they return to their initial states.
- This process of "adding up" waves is called **superposition**.
- **Constructive interference** is when overlapping waves produce a wave with an amplitude that is the sum of the individual waves.
    - This is when both pulses have the same direction of displacement, the heights are the sum of each individual heights.
- **Destructive interference** is when overlapping waves produce a wave with an amplitude that is less than the sum of the individual waves.
    - This is have both pulses are in opposing directions.
    - One of the waves is deemed “negative” and the addition becomes a subtraction of the “positive” pulse - the pulse in the opposing direction.

# Waves traveling mediums.

When happens when a waves travels into a different medium.

# Standing waves.

- In confined mediums, waves will reflect and bounce off of a medium’s boundaries.
- This reflection will make the wave overlap with itself.
- This is called **standing waves**.
    - When standing waves happen, they select preferred wavelengths and frequencies.
- **Nodes** are points on a standing wave where the wave stays in a fixed position over time because of destructive interference.
- **Anti-nodes** are points on a standing wave where the wave vibrates with maximum amplitude.
- Wavelengths & frequencies make standing waves when there is a node at each end.
    - Special wavelengths:
        - This wavelengths make standing waves because the nodes are evenly spaced across the medium.
        - Formula for special wavelengths:
            - *λn = (2L)/n*
                - *L* is the length of the medium.
                - *n* is the number of the **harmonic**, the positive integer multiple of the fundamental frequency.

# Simple harmonic motion.

- **Oscillator** goes back & forth to return to equilibrium position.
    - **The restoring force** returns it to initial position.
        - Overshoots the restore, the mass moves too far in the restoring direction, which makes for the oscillation. (Assume no friction).
- **Simple Harmonic Oscillators** have a restoring force that’s proportional to the displacement of the mass.
    - Restoring force changes with the amount of the change in mass’s position.
    - Described by *sin* and *cos* functions, as those are oscillating functions.
- Important points in the oscillation:
    - At the points of maximum compression or maximum extension, *v = 0*, no speed.
        - The restoring force has stopped the mass and this is right before the mass reverses direction.
    - Parts of the system:
        - Amplitude **(*A*)** is the maximum magnitude of displacement.
        - Period **(*T*)** is the time required for an “entire cycle”.
            - A cycle is the time from one end to another and back.
            - Change in amplitude doesn’t change the period.
        - Frequency **(*f*)** is the inverse of the period.
            - *f = 1/T*
    - Graphing the system:
        - Sinusoidal function: position **(*x*)** vs. time **(*t*)**.
        - Equations:
            - Start equilibrium: *x(t) = Asin(ωt)*
            - Start maximum: *x(t) = Acos(ωt)*
            - Start minimum: *x(t) = -Acos(ωt)*
            - *ω = 2π/T*
                - Remember T is the period.

# Spring oscillators.

- The spring itself provides the restoring force.
- **Hooke’s Law**: *Fs = -kx*.
    - In the vertical direction, *mg = -kx*.
    - *k* is the spring constant *[N/m]*.
        - More stiff means *k* is higher, and vice versa.
    - *x* is the displacement.
    - The *-* sign makes it a restoring force, it counters the motion direction.
- The equation for Hooke’s law shows that the force is proportional to the displacement.
    - Masses on springs are Simple Harmonic Oscillators.
- Period formula: *T = 2π * √(m/k)*
    - Increasing *m*, the mass increases the period.
    - Increasing *k*, spring constant, decreases period. 
    - Works in the vertical direction as well.
    - Doesn’t depend on gravity.

# Simple pendulums.

- A mass, m, attached to a string of length l, that can swing back & forth.
It is a simple harmonic oscillator, which means it can be represented by a sinusoidal function.
Gravity is the restoring force.
Adapted motion equations:
Start equilibrium: θ(t) = θMAXsin(ωt)
Start maximum: θ(t) = θMAXcos(ωt)
Start minimum: θ(t) = -θMAXcos(ωt)
ω = 2π/T
Remember T is the period.
θMAX is the amplitude 
The maximum angle the pendulum can make.
Period formula: T = 2π * √(L/g)
L is length of string.
Increase in L increases period.
g is the ACCELERATION due to gravity.
Increase in g decreases period.
Changing the mass doesn’t affect the period.

# Energy in oscillators.

- As mass oscillates, *PE* will turn to *KE*, and vice versa, repeatedly.
- Formulas:
    - *KE = (1/2)mv^2*
    - *PE = (1/2)kx^2*
- *ETOTAL = PE + KE = (1/2)kx^2 + (1/2)mv^2*
- When *PE* is maximum, *KE* is zero, *v* (velocity) is zero.
- When *PE* is zero, *KE* is maximum, *v* is maximum.

# Sound characteristics.

- Sound displaces air molecules and oscillates them.
    - The molecules get pushed, and return to their initial state, repeatedly.
    - The displacement of the air cause other air molecules to displace as well, and these displace more molecules, etc.
    - This ripple effect reaches your ear to create sound.
    - The air molecules oscillate in a sinusoidal pattern, aka. a periodic wave.
- A higher volume makes the air oscillations larger, and the sound loudens. 
- Connection to periodic waves.
    - The amplitude is the maximum displacement of the air molecule before it starts to return to its initial state.
        - This is not the length of the entire displacement.
        - It's the maximum displacement measured from equilibrium point.
    - The period **(*T*)** is the time an air molecule takes to move a cycle, or fully back & forth to the equilibrium position.
        - Decreasing the period decreases the time the air takes to oscillate and results in a higher perceived pitch, and vice versa.
    - The frequency **(*f*)** is the number cycles an air molecules displaces in a second.
        - Describes as *f = 1/T*
        - Lower frequency = lower pitch of the sound.
        - Higher frequency = higher pitch of the sound.
    - The wavelength **(*λ*)** is the distance between two compressed regions of air.
        - Can't be calculated normally from the *dt* graph because that graph represents an individual air molecule, so the distance between peaks on that graph would be the period.
    - Sound as a whole is a longitudinal wave.

# Standing sound waves.

- Tube with both ends open:
    - Molecules on both ends can oscillate.
    - However, the air in the middle of the tube is unable to oscillate.
    - This is a **standing wave** because the compressed regions aren’t explicitly moving, rather the particles appear to bounce back and forth the middle of the tube, where the air particles aren’t oscillating.
    - The particles further from the center are displacing by increasing amounts.
    - However, as you get close to the center, the displacements get closer to zero.
    - The middle doesn’t displace, so it’s a **node**.
    - The ends move the most, so they’re **anti-nodes**.
    - The length of this wave in this tube is half the wavelength.
        - If *L* is the tube’s length, *L = 0.5λ* or *λ = 2L*
    - Applying this to different harmonics:
        - *λN = (2L)/N*
            - This would have N nodes between the two end anti-nodes.
- Tube with one end open, one end closed:
    - Air oscillates on the open side of the tube. 
    - However, the air near the closed end doesn’t have space to oscillate.
    - Those molecules try to oscillate, but bump into the closed end and lose their energy.
    - This is a **standing wave** because the compressed regions aren’t explicitly moving, rather the particles appear to bounce back and forth from the closed side.
    - On the open end, there is an **anti-node**, because there is a lot of movement and oscillation.
    - On the closed end, there is a **node**, as it stays in place and doesn’t oscillate.
    - The length of this wave in this tube is ½ the wavelength.
    - If L is the tube’s length, L = 0.25λ or λ = 4L 
    - Applying this to different harmonics:
        - λN = (4L)/N, where N is an odd whole number.
            - This would have N nodes between the two end anti-nodes.
- Important note: the term **resonance** is synonymous with standing sound waves.
- Pressure/Displacement (Anti-)Nodes:
    - **Pressure Nodes** are where the pressure stays constant. 
        - At the open ends of closed tubes because the pressure at the ends equalizes with the atmosphere & stays constant throughout.
        - In the middle of open tubes because the pressure cancel out.
    - **Displacement Nodes** are where the particles don't change position or displace.
    - **Displacement Anti-Nodes** are where the molecules displace the most.
        - At the open ends of tubes because the particles at the end displace (by the amplitude) more than at anywhere else.

# Sound wave interference.

- Same frequencies:
    - If two waves with same frequencies are exactly overlapped, the sound would get louder due to constructive interference.
    - If they are are overlapped inversely, meaning wave A’s peaks are concurrent with wave B’s troughs and vice versa, destructive interference should cancel the whole thing out.
- Different frequencies:
    - This overlap starts off constructively, but over time, the differences in frequency would make an increasing discrepancy between the waves. 
    - The sound will cycle between being loud and soft, because the period discrepancy results in a constant back & forth between constructive and destructive interference.
    - Resultant wave:
- This is called **beat frequency**.
- Wobbles in volume when waves of different frequencies overlap.
    - *fB = |f1 - f2|*
    - The beat frequency is the difference between the two frequencies.
    - The # of times the superposed wave goes from constructive interference to destructive interference and back per second.

# Doppler effect.

- The Doppler Effect is a phenomenon where if a moving body is emitting a wave to a stationary object, the perceived frequency will be different that the wave’s true frequency.
- Stationary object emitting a *1 Hz* wave:
- Object moving at *5 [m/s]* emitting a *1 Hz* wave:
