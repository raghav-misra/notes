    -   How might the audience have affected the reliability of the source?
-   **Significance for Analysis:**
    -   Every document is created with an audience in mind, even if that audience is oneself. When creating a document, authors make decisions based on what they want the audience to know and believe. In doing so, the author might leave certain information out, emphasize some points rather than others, or adopt a specific tone or point of view. Understanding who the audience was presumed to be, and what impact the author wished to have on the audience needs to be identified and explained where this is seen in the document.

## Historical context.

-   **Questions:**
    -   When and where was the source produced?
    -   What contemporaneous events might affect the author’s viewpoint and/or message?
    -   How does the context affect the source?
-   **Significance of Analysis:**
    -   Identifying this time and place helps us understand purpose, but in order to understand the context, we need to go beyond simple identification. When a historian talks about context, he or she is referring to specific historical processes and events that can explain both the author’s reasons for writing the document and the ways in which contemporaries understood the document.
